# TEMPORARY BRANCH: Up-skilling to GEOS v11.4.2

This branch exists solely for up-skilling pyFV3 to be able run GEOS in it's v11.4.2 FP configuration.
The need for a seperate branch from `develop` rely in the following differences:

- GEOS run a 32bit floating point precision version (with appropriate 64bit buffers for mass conservation). This means the translate test requires a new set of data _and_ will not pass on old 8.1.3 Pace data.
- GEOS requires options that are deemed "legacy" and that we may want to replace rather than port
- Project requirements demand quick iterative development, while `pyFV3` demands concertation between all stakeholders.

The aim is to validate and benchmark GEOS v11.4.2 with this dynamics. Once done, we will aim to move _as much code as possible_ back into develop.
The methodology goes as follows

- Merge directly into `develop` any changes that do not demand a new set of data
- Keep track of the feature branch (below) that can't be merged in `develop` for future PR
- Keep track of GEOS vs SHiELD differences for future discussions
